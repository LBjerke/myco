# zlinter rules

## `declaration_naming`

Enforces that variable declaration names use consistent naming. For example,
`snake_case` for non-types, `TitleCase` for types and `camelCase` for functions.

**Config options:**

* `exclude_extern`

  * Exclude extern / foreign declarations. An extern declaration refers to a foreign declaration — typically defined outside of Zig, such as in a C library or other system-provided binary. You typically don't want to enforce naming conventions on these declarations.

  * **Default:** `true`

* `exclude_export`

  * Exclude exported declarations. Export makes the symbol visible to external code, such as C or other languages that might link against your Zig code. You may prefer to rely on the naming conventions of the code being linked, in which case, you may set this to true.

  * **Default:** `false`

* `exclude_aliases`

  * When true the linter will exclude naming checks for declarations that have the same name as the field they're aliasing (e.g., `pub const FAILURE = system.FAILURE`). In these cases it can often be better to be consistent and to leave the naming convention up to the definition being aliased.

  * **Default:** `true`

* `var_decl`

  * Style and severity for declarations with `const` mutability.

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .snake_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `const_decl`

  * Style and severity for declarations with `var` mutability.

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .snake_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `decl_that_is_type`

  * Style and severity for type declarations.

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .title_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `decl_that_is_namespace`

  * Style and severity for namespace declarations.

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .snake_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `decl_that_is_fn`

  * Style and severity for non-type function declarations.

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .camel_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `decl_that_is_type_fn`

  * Style and severity type function declarations.

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .title_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `decl_name_min_len`

  * Minimum length of a declarations name. To exclude names from this check see `decl_name_exclude_len` option. Set to `.off` to disable this check.

  * **Default:** `.{ .len = 3, .severity = .warning, }`

* `decl_name_max_len`

  * Maximum length of an `error` field name. To exclude names from this check see `decl_name_exclude_len` option. Set to `.off` to disable this check.

  * **Default:** `.{ .len = 30, .severity = .warning, }`

* `decl_name_exclude_len`

  * Exclude these declaration names from min and max declaration name checks.

  * **Default:** `&.{ "x", "y", "z", "i", "b" }`

## `field_naming`

Enforces a consistent naming convention for fields in containers. For
example, `struct`, `enum`, `union`, `opaque` and `error`.

**Config options:**

* `error_field`

  * Style and severity for errors defined within an `error { ... }` container

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .title_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `error_field_min_len`

  * Minimum length of an `error` field name. To exclude names from this check see `error_field_exclude_len` option. Set to `.off` to disable this check.

  * **Default:** `.{ .len = 3, .severity = .warning, }`

* `error_field_max_len`

  * Maximum length of an `error` field name. To exclude names from this check see `error_field_exclude_len` option. Set to `.off` to disable this check.

  * **Default:** `.{ .len = 30, .severity = .warning, }`

* `error_field_exclude_len`

  * Exclude these `error` field names from min and max `error` field name checks.

  * **Default:** `&.{}`

* `enum_field`

  * Style and severity for enum values defined within an `enum { ... }` container

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .snake_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `enum_field_min_len`

  * Minimum length of an `enum` field name. To exclude names from this check see `enum_field_exclude_len` option. Set to `.off` to disable this check.

  * **Default:** `.{ .len = 3, .severity = .warning, }`

* `enum_field_max_len`

  * Maximum length of an `enum` field name. To exclude names from this check see `enum_field_exclude_len` option. Set to `.off` to disable this check.

  * **Default:** `.{ .len = 30, .severity = .warning, }`

* `struct_field_exclude_len`

  * Exclude these `struct` field names from min and max `struct` field name checks.

  * **Default:** `&.{ "x", "y", "z", "i", "b" }`

  * Like `struct_field` but for fields with type `type`

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .title_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `struct_field_that_is_namespace`

  * Like `struct_field` but for fields with a namespace type

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .snake_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `struct_field_that_is_fn`

  * Like `struct_field` but for fields with a callable/function type

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .camel_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

  * Maximum length of a `union` field name. To exclude names from this check see `union_field_exclude_len` option. Set to `.off` to disable this check.

  * **Default:** `.{ .len = 30, .severity = .warning, }`

* `union_field_exclude_len`

  * Exclude these `union` field names from min and max `union` field name checks.

  * **Default:** `&.{ "x", "y", "z", "i", "b" }`

## `field_ordering`

Enforce a consistent, predictable order for fields in structs, enums, and unions.

`field_ordering` supports auto fixes with the `--fix` flag. It may take multiple runs with `--fix` to fix all places.

**Auto fixing is an experimental feature so only use it if you use source control - always back up your code first!**

**Config options:**

* `union_field_order`

  * Order and severity for union fields. If you're setting this and use tagged unions (e.g., `union(MyEnum)`) then you will also need to set the same order for enums.

  * **Default:** `.{ .order = .alphabetical_ascending, .severity = .warning, }`

* `struct_field_order`

  * Order and severity for struct fields

  * **Default:** `.off`

* `exclude_packed_structs`

  * Whether to check order of packed structs (e.g., `packed struct(u32) { .. }`). You probably never want to enforce order of packed structs, so best to leave as `true` unless you're certain.

  * **Default:** `true`

* `exclude_extern_structs`

  * Whether to check order of extern structs (e.g., `extern struct { .. }`). You probably never want to enforce order of extern structs, so best to leave as `true` unless you're certain.

  * **Default:** `true`

* `enum_field_order`

  * Order and severity for enum fields. If you're setting this and use tagged unions (e.g., `union(MyEnum)`) then you will also need to set the same order for unions.

  * **Default:** `.{ .order = .alphabetical_ascending, .severity = .warning, }`

## `file_naming`

Enforces a consistent naming convention for files. For example, `TitleCase`
for implicit structs and `snake_case` for namespaces.

**Config options:**

* `file_namespace`

  * Style and severity for a file that is a namespace (i.e., does not have root container fields)

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .snake_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `file_struct`

  * Style and severity for a file that is a struct (i.e., has root container fields)

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .title_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

## `function_naming`

Enforces consistent naming of functions. For example, `TitleCase` for functions
that return types and `camelCase` for others.

**Config options:**

* `exclude_extern`

  * Exclude extern / foreign functions. An extern function refers to a foreign function — typically defined outside of Zig, such as in a C library or other system-provided binary. You typically don't want to enforce naming conventions on these functions.

  * **Default:** `true`

* `exclude_export`

  * Exclude exported functions. Export makes the symbol visible to external code, such as C or other languages that might link against your Zig code. You may prefer to rely on the naming conventions of the code being linked, in which case, you may set this to true.

  * **Default:** `false`

* `function`

  * Style and severity for non-type functions

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .camel_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `function_that_returns_type`

  * Style and severity for type functions

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .title_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `function_arg`

  * Style and severity for standard function arg

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .snake_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `function_arg_that_is_type`

  * Style and severity for type function arg

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .title_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `function_arg_that_is_fn`

  * Style and severity for non-type function function arg

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .camel_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

* `function_arg_that_is_type_fn`

  * Style and severity for type function function arg

  * **Default:** `.{ .style = .title_case, .severity = .@"error", }`

## `import_ordering`

> [!WARNING]
> The `import_ordering` rule is still under testing and development. It may
> not work as expected and may change without notice.

Enforces a consistent ordering of `@import` declarations in Zig source files.

Maintaining a standardized import order improves readability and reduces
merge conflicts.

`import_ordering` supports auto fixes with the `--fix` flag. It may take multiple runs with `--fix` to fix all places.

**Auto fixing is an experimental feature so only use it if you use source control - always back up your code first!**

**Config options:**

* `severity`

  * The severity (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `order`

  * The order that the imports appear in.

  * **Default:** `.alphabetical_ascending`

* `allow_line_separated_chunks`

  * Whether or not the linter allows imports to be separated by blank lines (i.e., separate blocks), where each chunk needs to follow the linter rules or whether they must all follow as a single chunk.

  * **Default:** `true`

## `max_positional_args`

Enforces that a function does not define too many positional arguments.

Keeping positional argument lists short improves readability and encourages
concise designs.

If the function is doing too many things, consider splitting it up
into smaller more focused functions. Alternatively, accept a struct with
appropriate defaults.

**Config options:**

* `severity`

  * The severity (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `max`

  * The max number of positional arguments. Functions with more than this many arguments will fail the rule.

  * **Default:** `5`

* `exclude_extern`

  * Exclude extern / foreign functions. An extern function refers to a foreign function — typically defined outside of Zig, such as in a C library or other system-provided binary. You typically don't want to enforce naming conventions on these functions.

  * **Default:** `true`

* `exclude_export`

  * Exclude exported functions. Export makes the symbol visible to external code, such as C or other languages that might link against your Zig code. You may prefer to rely on the naming conventions of the code being linked, in which case, you may set this to true.

  * **Default:** `false`

## `no_comment_out_code`

Discourage leaving commented-out code in committed files.

**Why?**

Commenting out blocks of old or unused code might seem helpful during development, but leaving them behind creates clutter and confusion over time.

**Problems:**

* Makes files noisy - harder to read and navigate.
* Creates dead code that might be mistakenly reused or assumed to be maintained.
* Can increase merge conflicts and noise in diffs.
* Hides real version history — version control should preserve old code, not your comments!

**What to do instead?**:

* If you don’t need it, delete it — you can always recover it from version control.
* If it’s experimental, keep it on a branch or behind a flag instead.

**Notes:**

* Comments that contain back ticks, like `this("example")` will be ignored
* The heuristic of what looks like code isn't perfect and may have false
negatives (e.g., commenting out struct fields) but will slowly improve
overtime as the linter evolves.

**Config options:**

* `severity`

  * The severity (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

## `no_deprecated`

Enforces that references aren't deprecated (i.e., doc commented with `Deprecated:`)

If you're indefinitely targetting fixed versions of a dependency or zig
then using deprecated items may not be a big deal. Although, it's still
worth undertsanding why they're deprecated, as there may be risks associated
with use.

**Config options:**

* `severity`

  * The severity of deprecations (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

## `no_empty_block`

Disallows empty code blocks `{}` unless explicitly allowed or documented.

Empty blocks are often a sign of incomplete or accidentally removed code.
They can make intent unclear and mislead maintainers into thinking logic
is missing.

In some cases, empty blocks are intentional (e.g. placeholder, scoping, or
looping constructs). This rule helps distinguish between accidental
emptiness and intentional no-op by requiring either a configuration
exception or a comment.

For example,

```zig
// OK - as comment within block.
if (something) {
  // do nothing
} else {
  doThing();
}
```

**Config options:**

* `if_block`

  * Severity for empty `if` blocks

  * **Default:** `.@"error"`

* `while_block`

  * Severity for empty `while` blocks

  * **Default:** `.off`

* `for_block`

  * Severity for empty `for` blocks

  * **Default:** `.@"error"`

* `catch_block`

  * Severity for empty `catch` blocks

  * **Default:** `.off`

* `switch_case_block`

  * Severity for empty switch case blocks

  * **Default:** `.off`

* `defer_block`

  * Severity for empty `defer` blocks

  * **Default:** `.@"error"`

* `errdefer_block`

  * Severity for empty `errdefer` blocks

  * **Default:** `.@"error"`

* `fn_decl_block`

  * Severity for empty `fn` declaration blocks

  * **Default:** `.@"error"`

## `no_hidden_allocations`

Avoid encapsulating hidden heap allocations inside functions without
requiring the caller to pass an allocator.

The caller should decide where and when to allocate not the callee.

**Config options:**

* `severity`

  * The severity of hidden allocations (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `detect_allocators`

  * What kinds of allocators to detect.

  * **Default:** `&.{ .page_allocator, .c_allocator, .general_purpose_allocator, .debug_allocator, }`

* `exclude_tests`

  * Skip if found within `test { ... }` block.

  * **Default:** `true`

## `no_inferred_error_unions`

Disallow using inferred error sets in function return types — always declare them explicitly.

In Zig, when you write `!T` as a return type without an explicit error set
(e.g. `!void`), Zig infers the error set from whatever operations inside the
function can fail.

This is powerful, but it can:

* Make APIs harder to understand - the possible errors aren’t visible at the signature.
* Make refactoring risky - adding or changing a failing operation silently changes the function’s error type.
* Lead to brittle dependencies - downstream callers may break if the inferred error set grows or changes.

The goal of the rule is to keep error contracts clear and stable. If it can fail, say how.

**Config options:**

* `severity`

  * The severity of inferred error unions (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `allow_private`

  * Allow inferred error unions for private functions.

  * **Default:** `true`

* `allow_anyerror`

  * Allow `anyerror` as the explicit error.

  * **Default:** `true`

## `no_literal_args`

Disallow passing primitive literal numbers and booleans directly as
function arguments.

Passing literal `1`, `0`, `true`, or `false` directly to a function is
ambiguous.

These magic literals don’t explain what they mean. Consider using named
constants or if you're the owner of the API and there's multiple arguments,
consider introducing a struct argument

**Config options:**

* `detect_char_literal`

  * The severity of detecting char literals (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.off`

* `detect_string_literal`

  * The severity of detecting string literals (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.off`

* `detect_number_literal`

  * The severity of detecting number literals (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.off`

* `detect_bool_literal`

  * The severity of detecting bool literals (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `exclude_tests`

  * Skip if found within `test { ... }` block.

  * **Default:** `true`

* `exclude_fn_names`

  * Skip if the literal argument is to a function with given name (case-sensitive).

  * **Default:** `&.{ "print", "alloc", "allocWithOptions", "allocWithOptionsRetAddr", "allocSentinel", "alignedAlloc", "allocAdvancedWithRetAddr", "resize", "realloc", "reallocAdvanced", "parseInt", "IntFittingRange", }`

## `no_literal_only_bool_expression`

Disallow boolean expressions that consist only of literal values.

If a boolean expression always evaluates to true or false, the statement is
redundant and likely unintended. Remove it or replace it with a meaningful
condition.

For example,

```zig
// Bad
if (1 == 1) {
  // always true
}

// Bad
if (false) {
  // always false
}

// Ok
while (true) {
   break;
}
```

**Config options:**

* `severity`

  * The severity (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.@"error"`

## `no_orelse_unreachable`

Enforces use of `.?` over `orelse unreachable` as `.?` offers comptime checks
as it does not control flow.

**Config options:**

* `severity`

  * The severity (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

## `no_panic`

Enforces that there are no uses of `@panic`.

`@panic` forcibly stops the program at runtime — it should be a last resort.

Panics can be replaced with:

* Proper error handling (error types and try / catch)
* Precondition checks (std.debug.assert) that fail only in debug mode
* Compile-time checks (comptime) when possible

Panics may be useful during early development, but leaving them in shipped code leads to:

* Abrupt crashes that break user trust
* Hard-to-debug failures in production
* Missed opportunities for graceful recovery

By default this will not flag `@panic` found in `test` blocks.

**Good:**

```zig
pub fn divide(x: i32, y: i32) i32 {
  if (y == 0) @panic("Divide by zero!");
  return x / y;
}
```

**Bad:**

```zig
pub fn divide(x: i32, y: i32) !i32 {
  if (y == 0) return error.DivideByZero;
  return x / y;
}
```

**Config options:**

* `severity`

  * The severity of using `@panic` (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `exclude_tests`

  * Skip if found within `test { ... }` block.

  * **Default:** `true`

* `exclude_panic_with_content`

  * Skip `@panic(...)` calls where the content equals a given string (case sensitive). For example, maybe your application is happy to panic on OOM, so it would be reasonable to add "OOM" to the list here so `@panic("OOM")` is allowed.

  * **Default:** `&.{}`

## `no_swallow_error`

Disallow silently swallowing errors without proper handling or logging.

For example, `catch {}` and `catch unreachable`

**Config options:**

* `detect_catch_unreachable`

  * The severity of detecting `catch unreachable` or `catch { unreachable; } (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `detect_empty_catch`

  * The severity of detecting `catch {}` (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `detect_empty_else`

  * The severity of detecting `else |_| {}` (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `detect_else_unreachable`

  * The severity of detecting `else |_| unreachable` or `else |_| { unreachable; }` (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `exclude_tests`

  * Skip if found within `test { ... }` block.

  * **Default:** `true`

## `no_todo`

Disallows todo comments

`TODO` comments are often used to indicate missing logic, features or the existence
of bugs. While this is useful during development, leaving them untracked can
lead to them being forgotten or not prioritised correctly.

If you must leave a todo comment it's best to include a link to an issue
in your issue tracker so it's visible, prioritized and won't be forgotten.

**Config options:**

* `severity`

  * The severity (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `exclude_if_contains_issue_number`

  * Exclude todo comments that contain a `#[0-9]+` in a word token or nested in the todo suffix. For example, `// TODO(#10): <info>` or `// TODO: Fix #10`

  * **Default:** `true`

* `exclude_if_contains_url`

  * Exclude todo comments that contain a url in a word token or nested in the todo suffix. For example, `// TODO(http://my-issue-tracker.com/10): <info>` or `// TODO: Fix http://my-issue-tracker.com/10`

  * **Default:** `true`

## `no_undefined`

Enforces no uses of `undefined`. There are some valid use case, in which
case uses should disable the line with an explanation.

**Config options:**

* `severity`

  * The severity (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `exclude_in_fn`

  * Skip if found in a function call (case-insenstive).

  * **Default:** `&.{"deinit"}`

* `exclude_tests`

  * Skip if found within `test { ... }` block.

  * **Default:** `true`

* `exclude_var_decl_name_equals`

  * Skips var declarations that name equals (case-insensitive, for `var`, not `const`).

  * **Default:** `&.{}`

* `exclude_var_decl_name_ends_with`

  * Skips var declarations that name ends in (case-insensitive, for `var`, not `const`).

  * **Default:** `&.{ "memory", "mem", "buffer", "buf", "buff", }`

* `init_method_names`

  * Skips when the undefined variable has this method called on it.

  * **Default:** `&.{ "init", "initialize", "initialise" }`

## `no_unused`

Enforces that container declarations are referenced.

`no_unused` supports auto fixes with the `--fix` flag. It may take multiple runs with `--fix` to fix all places.

**Auto fixing is an experimental feature so only use it if you use source control - always back up your code first!**

**Config options:**

* `container_declaration`

  * The severity for container declarations that are unused (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

## `require_braces`

Requires specific brace `{}` usage for the bodies of `if`, `else`, `while`,
`for`, `defer` and `catch` statements.

By requiring braces, you're consistent and avoid ambiguity, which can code
easier to maintain, and prevent unintended logic changes when adding new
lines.

If an `if` statement is used as part of a return or assignment it is excluded
from this rule (braces not required).

For example, the following two examples will be ignored by this rule.

```zig
const label = if (x > 10) "over 10" else "under 10";
```

and

```zig
return if (x > 20)
   "over 20"
else
   "under 20";
```

**Config options:**

* `if_statement`

  * Requirement for `if` statements

  * **Default:** `.{ .severity = .warning, .requirement = .multi_line_only, }`

* `while_statement`

  * Requirement for `while` statements

  * **Default:** `.{ .severity = .off, .requirement = .multi_line_only, }`

* `for_statement`

  * Requirement for for statements

  * **Default:** `.{ .severity = .warning, .requirement = .multi_line_only, }`

* `catch_statement`

  * Requirement for `catch` statements

  * **Default:** `.{ .severity = .warning, .requirement = .multi_line_only, }`

* `switch_case_statement`

  * Requirement for `switch` statements

  * **Default:** `.{ .severity = .off, .requirement = .multi_line_only, }`

* `defer_statement`

  * Requirement for `defer` statements

  * **Default:** `.{ .severity = .off, .requirement = .multi_line_only, }`

* `errdefer_statement`

  * Requirement for `errdefer` statements

  * **Default:** `.{ .severity = .off, .requirement = .multi_line_only, }`

## `require_doc_comment`

Require doc comments for all public functions, types, and constants.

Unless you're maintaining an open API used by other projects this rule is more than
likely unnecessary, and in some cases, can encourage avoidable noise on
otherwise simple APIs.

**Config options:**

* `public_severity`

  * The severity when missing doc comments on public declarations (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.warning`

* `private_severity`

  * The severity when missing doc comments on private declarations (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.off`

* `file_severity`

  * The severity when missing doc comments on top of the file (off, warning, error).

  * **Default:** `.off`

## `require_errdefer_dealloc`

> [!WARNING]
> The `require_errdefer_dealloc` rule is still under testing and development.
> It may not work as expected and may change without notice.

Ensure that any allocation made within a function that can return an error
is paired with `errdefer`, unless the resource is already being released in
a `defer` block.

**Why?**

If a function returns an error, it's signaling a recoverable condition
within the application's normal control flow. Failing to perform cleanup
in these cases can lead to memory leaks.

**Caveats:**

* This rule is not exhaustive. It makes a best-effort attempt to detect known
  object declarations that require cleanup.

* This rule cannot always reliably detect usage of fixed buffer allocators or
  arenas; however, using `errdefer array.deinit(arena);` in these cases is
  generally harmless. It will do its best to ignore the most obvious cases.

**Example:**

```zig
// Bad: On success, returns an owned slice the caller must free; on error, memory is leaked.
pub fn message(age: u8, allocator: std.mem.Allocator) error{ OutOfMemory, InvalidAge }![]const u8 {
    var parts = std.ArrayList(u8).init(allocator);
